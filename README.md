# STM32F10x-LED-DevBoard
The board is based on the stm32 microcontroller to manage 100 LEDs with a direct voltage of 3.2-3.4V and an operating current of 20mA. The power supply of the board is 12V. All LEDs are be dimmable due to the PWM. Board provides contact pads for connecting external devices via SPI, as well as a programmer via SWD.
